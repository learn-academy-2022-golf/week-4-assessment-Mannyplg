# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Only difference I see between the two are naming convention and purpose. REACTs State for example, is a small piece of a program chained to others. OOB has built in functions that only operates as a function, such as console.log. 

Researched answer: In Object oriented programming, objects hold data about them in attributes. The attributes are manipulated through functions or methods that are given to object. Functional programming should always have the same outputs given the same inputs.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: Integer is a numerical data type. A Float is the numerical data with decimals.

Researched answer: Each number type is associated with a number class and can manipulated using methods. Floats and Integers each are umber classes converted using methods. 

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?
No need for a return statement. In Ruby, the return is automatically implied.

Your answer: The last set of instructions asked will be executed in the program.

Researched answer:

4. What is a block in Ruby?
Ruby is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) that uses classes as blueprints for objects. Objects are the basic building-blocks of Ruby code (everything in Ruby is an object).

Your answer: Blocks are anonymous functions can be passed into methods. 

Researched answer: A ruby blocks are anonymous functions. Enclosed in a do-end statement or curly braces. Arguments are defined between pipe characters.  

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: Is a data structure, that shares data in key value pairs. They do not have numerical indexes. Values are accessible through keys.

Researched answer: Two methods within the Hash class, .keys and .values are used to extract all information in an array. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: Child class inherits similar properties from parent class.

2. RSpec: is a testing tool for Ruby similiar to jest for JavaScript. 

3. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete are are action request in HTTP on software programs

4. Test-driven development: Writing tests, seeing them fail, and then creating the code that makes the test pass is called test driven development 

5. HTTP: The internet. Rules that is followed for data shared over the Web.
